# Assembly and Installation

The hardware for the water alarm consists primarily of a NodeMCU ESP8266 development board, and a makeshift shield that supports the water detecting probe and two status LED. At the time of writing this, the consumable components for building the water alarm hardware costed approximately £8, including post and packaging. It is worth noting however that many of these components cannot be bought as singular items. Although a white LED costs approximately £0.10, you will find it difficult to buy a single white LED.
